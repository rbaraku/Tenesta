## 🧠 What is Tenesta?

Tenesta is a rental relationship platform that helps tenants and landlords track rent, leases, communication, and disputes — all in one place. Think: the trust layer between renters and landlords.

It’s not just a payment app. Tenesta provides documentation, accountability, and visibility where it didn’t exist before.

## 🔥 What problem does it solve?

- **No paper trail** during disputes  
- **Verbal agreements** that get broken  
- **Untracked security deposits**  
- **Lease violations without evidence**  
- **Unreachable landlords or tenants**

Tenants get burned. Landlords get ghosted. Tenesta fixes that with receipts, records, and transparency — for both sides.

## 🎯 Who is it for?

- **Tenants** who want digital protection, proof, and peace of mind
