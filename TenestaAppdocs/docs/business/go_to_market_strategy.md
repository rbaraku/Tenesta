# Tenesta Go-To-Market Strategy

Effective Date: August 2, 2025  
Maintained by: Tenesta Product & Growth Team  
Audience: Internal team, advisors, investors

---

## Overview

Tenesta solves real and widespread pain in the rental market: poor communication, no legal trail, untracked payments, and mistrust between tenants and landlords. Our go-to-market (GTM) strategy is focused on launching a trusted, tenant-first platform while onboarding landlords through utility, not hype.

---

## Target Markets

### 🎯 Primary:
- **Urban renters aged 20–35** in high-turnover areas (Chicago, NYC, LA)
- **Small landlords** managing 2–15 units who lack modern tools

### 💼 Secondary:
- University students / off-campus renters
- Local legal aid orgs and housing support networks
- Mom-and-pop property management firms

---

## Launch Timeline (Q3–Q4 2025)

- **August** — Closed alpha (TestFlight) with family/friends  
- **September** — Public beta for tenants, full feature test  
- **October** — Landlord Pro dashboard + pricing model live  
- **November** — Content push (TikTok, Reddit, housing forums)  
- **December** — First 1000 users + testimonials + media outreach  

---

## Acquisition Channels

- **TikTok / YouTube Shorts** – Skits showing bad landlord/tenant scenarios, ending with “This wouldn’t happen on Tenesta.”
- **Reddit AMA Campaigns** – Threads in r/tenant, r/legaladvice, r/landlord  
- **Referral Program** – $5 gift cards or rent discounts for sign-ups
- **Craigslist-style inserts** – Small ads included in university housing listings
- **Partnerships** – Target legal aid clinics, renter unions, housing Facebook groups

---

## Differentiators

- **Not just rent payment** — Tenesta includes:
  - Chat receipts
  - Lease violation tracking
  - Security deposit ledger
  - Uploadable proof & private notes

- **Built for both sides** — Clear, fair, and documented tools for **both tenants and landlords**  
- **Serious documentation** — We don’t play around with legal stuff. Users can download full PDF trails for court or dispute protection.

---

## Success Benchmarks (First 6 Months)

- 📈 1000+ signups (split 60% tenant / 40% landlord)
- 🗂 500+ uploaded documents
- 💬 300+ dispute-resolution chats logged
- 💳 $10k+ processed via payment dashboard
- 🧾 50+ reviews across platforms (Google, Reddit, TikTok)

---

## Long-Term Vision

Tenesta becomes the **default trust layer** between renters and landlords. We’ll scale from the U.S. market into localized tools, legal bots, and B2B APIs for small property firms.

This isn’t just another rental app. It’s housing infrastructure for the modern renter.
