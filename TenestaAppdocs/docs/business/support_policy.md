🚫 Disputes between tenants and landlords (we provide tools, not judgments)  
🚫 Offline rent issues not logged in Tenesta  
🚫 Property maintenance or inspections

## 🛠 Escalations

- Reports involving harassment, discrimination, or fraud are escalated to our Trust & Safety team.
- Emergency situations (e.g., threats of harm, police reports) may involve law enforcement in accordance with our privacy policy and legal duty.

---

## 🧠 Our Philosophy

- **Document everything.** We treat every message as if it might end up in court.
- **Bias toward resolution.** We help tenants and landlords find the paper trail they need.
- **No gaslighting, no ghosting.** Our support staff is trained in trauma-informed communication.

When rent gets messy, we’re here to help make it clean and documented.
