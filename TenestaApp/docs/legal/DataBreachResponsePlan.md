# Tenesta Data Breach Response Plan

Effective Date: August 2, 2025  
Maintained by: Tenesta Security & Compliance Team  
Applies To: All systems storing or processing personal or sensitive user data

---

## Purpose

This plan outlines the steps Tenesta will take in the event of a data breach. Our goal is to respond swiftly, minimize harm, and remain fully transparent with users and regulators.

---

## 1. Detection and Identification

Breaches may be identified via:

- Intrusion detection systems or alerts  
- Anomalous activity from internal monitoring tools  
- Reports from users, employees, or third-party services

Once a potential incident is flagged, it will be escalated to the **Incident Response Team (IRT)** within 1 hour.

---

## 2. Containment and Analysis

Once confirmed:

- Affected systems are isolated to prevent further damage  
- Access credentials may be reset across affected services  
- A forensic log is initiated  
- Affected scope is determined (type of data, users impacted)

---

## 3. Notification Protocol

If the breach involves personal data:

- Users will be notified via email within **72 hours** of discovery  
- Notifications will include:
  - What happened
  - What information was affected
  - Recommended next steps
  - Contact details for further help

If legally required, regulators (e.g., **U.S. state AGs**, **EU DPA**, **California Privacy Protection Agency**) will also be informed.

---

## 4. Mitigation and Remediation

Post-breach actions include:

- Fixing exploited vulnerabilities  
- Improving detection and response processes  
- Enhancing employee security training  
- Updating security infrastructure or policies

---

## 5. Documentation and Follow-Up

All breach-related actions are documented in our internal **Security Incident Register**. A full incident report is reviewed by:

- Security & Engineering Leads  
- Legal and Compliance Teams  
- Executive Leadership

Post-incident audits are conducted within 7 days.

---

## 6. User Support

Tenesta offers support to affected users including:

- Temporary account locking and reset  
- Monitoring suggestions (e.g., credit, identity theft)  
- Priority customer service assistance
