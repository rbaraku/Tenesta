## Our Commitment

Tenesta is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for all users, including those with disabilities. We believe every tenant and landlord — regardless of ability — deserves full access to our tools and services.

We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying relevant accessibility standards such as:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**  
- **Section 508 (U.S. federal accessibility standard)**  
- **ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act)**

---

## What We’re Doing

- Clear keyboard navigation support for users without a mouse  
- Mobile accessibility support with screen reader compatibility (iOS & Android)  
- ARIA labels and semantic HTML in all web interfaces  
- Sufficient color contrast and scalable font sizes  
- Regular testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA, JAWS)  
- Feedback channels for accessibility issues

---

## Current Limitations (in development)

We’re actively working on:
- Full voice control integration  
- Custom tenant forms with tab order refinement  
- Keyboard-only navigation for document uploads  
- Captcha alternatives for account verification

---

## Feedback and Reporting

If you encounter an accessibility issue or barrier, please contact:  
**accessibility@tenesta.com**  
We aim to respond within **3 business days**.

## Statement Updates

This accessibility statement is reviewed and updated every 90 days or when substantial UI/UX changes are released.

Tenesta is for **everyone**. We're building tech that adapts to all — not just the able.
