# Frontend Development Checkpoint

> **Date:** August 2, 2025  
> **Phase:** Authentication & Navigation Complete  
> **Next Session:** Debug errors and continue with dashboard features

## 🎯 Current Status

### ✅ **Completed This Session:**

1. **Complete Authentication Flow**
   - Sign In screen with full functionality
   - Sign Up screen with role selection and validation
   - Forgot Password screen with email reset flow
   - All forms include comprehensive validation

2. **Full Navigation System**
   - Stack navigation for auth screens
   - Bottom tab navigation for main app
   - Role-based routing (tenant vs landlord)
   - TypeScript navigation types

3. **Core App Architecture**
   - Redux Toolkit state management
   - Supabase integration services
   - Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card)
   - Real-time services setup
   - API integration layer

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Built-in testing utilities
   - Environment validation
   - Frontend-backend integration tests

### ⚠️ **Known Issues to Debug:**

1. **Navigation/Bundle Errors**
   - Package version compatibility warnings
   - Potential gesture handler conflicts
   - TypeScript version mismatch warnings
   - Bundle rebuild issues

2. **Specific Error Details:**
   ```
   react-native-gesture-handler@2.27.2 - expected version: ~2.16.1
   react-native-reanimated@4.0.1 - expected version: ~3.10.1
