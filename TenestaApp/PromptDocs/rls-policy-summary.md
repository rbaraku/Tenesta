## 🛠️ Helper Functions

### Security-Enhanced Functions
All functions now use `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path = public`:

1. **`is_admin(user_id)`** - Check if user is an admin
2. **`get_user_organization(user_id)`** - Get user's organization ID
3. **`is_property_landlord(user_id, property_id)`** - Check landlord status
4. **`is_property_tenant(user_id, property_id)`** - Check tenant status
5. **`has_permission(user_id, permission_code)`** - Check specific permissions
6. **`is_member_of_organization(org_id)`** - Check org membership
7. **`is_associated_with_tenancy(tenancy_id)`** - Check tenancy association

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only see what they need
2. **Organization Isolation**: Complete data separation between organizations
3. **Role-Based Access**: Different permissions for tenants, landlords, staff, and admins
4. **Audit Trail**: All actions are logged and traceable
5. **Function Security**: All SQL functions use secure search paths

## 📋 Policy Patterns Used

### Read Policies (SELECT)
- Own data: `user_id = auth.uid()`
- Organization data: `organization_id = get_user_organization(auth.uid())`
- Associated data: Complex joins checking relationships

### Write Policies (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Ownership verification
- Role-based permissions
- Business logic enforcement

### System Operations
- Special policies for automated processes
- Webhook handling
- AI analysis results

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test RLS Policies**: Create test cases for each user role
2. **Performance Optimization**: Add indexes for policy conditions
3. **Monitoring**: Set up RLS policy violation alerts
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed access matrix for each role

## 📌 Important Notes

- All financial data (payments, billing) has extra security layers
- Personal information (notes, preferences) is strictly private
- Document access follows tenancy relationships
- Admin users have elevated but audited access
- System processes use service-level authentication
