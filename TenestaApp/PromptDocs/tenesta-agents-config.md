### Usage Examples
```bash
# Start Claude Code
cd /path/to/Tenesta
claude

# Call specific agents
/product-director analyze tenant dashboard priority
/react-native-lead implement authentication flow
/api-architect fix critical backend issues
/squad-sync implement rent payment feature

# Run workflows
/fix-backend-critical
/setup-frontend

```

### Agent Communication Protocol
1. Agents can reference other agents using their command names
2. Use `/squad-sync` for multi-team features
3. Technical Director reviews all architectural decisions
4. Product Director sets priorities and deadlines
5. Squad leads coordinate within their teams

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Fix critical backend issues
2. **Phase 2**: Set up frontend infrastructure
3. **Phase 3**: Implement core tenant features
4. **Phase 4**: Implement landlord features
5. **Phase 5**: Add AI capabilities
6. **Phase 6**: Performance optimization
7. **Phase 7**: Launch preparation

### Key Principles
- Each agent has focused responsibilities
- Agents delegate to avoid overload
- Parallel work streams when possible
- Clear documentation and testing
- Follow PRD requirements strictly
- Maintain high code quality standards
- Prioritize user experience
- Ensure security and compliance

### Quick Reference
- **Backend Issues**: Use `/fix-backend-critical`
- **New Feature**: Start with `/product-director` then `/squad-sync`
- **UI Work**: `/ux-researcher` → `/ui-designer` → `/component-developer`
- **API Work**: `/api-architect` → `/database-engineer` → `/test-automation`
- **Deployment**: `/devops-engineer` → `/performance-engineer`
