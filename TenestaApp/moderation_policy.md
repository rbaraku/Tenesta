- Fair investigation procedures  
- No tolerance for threats, harassment, or discrimination

## 👮‍♀️ What We Monitor

We monitor and respond to the following activity (automated and user-reported):

- Messaging between users  
- Uploaded documents or notes containing harmful content  
- Fake listings or misrepresentation  
- Harassment, threats, or discrimination in communication  
- Attempts to bypass platform policies (e.g. direct payments to avoid logs)

## 🛠 Moderation Actions

| Severity | Action Taken |
|----------|--------------|
| Minor (e.g., inappropriate language) | Warning and coaching |
| Medium (e.g., fake listings) | Temporary account suspension |
| Major (e.g., threats, discrimination) | Immediate ban and report to authorities if needed |

---

## Reporting Content

Users can report:
- Messages
- Listings
- Uploaded documents
- Profile behaviors

Each report is reviewed manually within **24 hours**.

## Dispute Resolution

In tenant-landlord conflicts:
- We remain neutral unless platform abuse is proven  
- We may request documentation or chat history  
- Repeat escalations can lead to profile audits or removal

---

## Human Oversight

All decisions are reviewed by our Trust & Safety team. We don’t rely solely on AI or automation for high-impact moderation actions.

## Appeals

Users may submit appeals within 5 days of any enforcement to:  
📧 **appeals@tenesta.com**

## Summary

We are building a safe, fair housing environment. Moderation ensures no user — tenant or landlord — is subject to abuse, manipulation, or unsafe experiences while using Tenesta.

This policy evolves with community needs and legal requirements.
